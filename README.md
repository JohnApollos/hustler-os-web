## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Because this project uses the Tailwind CDN, you don't need `npm` or `node_modules`.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hustler-os-web.git
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`** in any browser.
      * *Tip:* For the best experience, use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.

## 📲 App Download Flow

The primary goal of this landing page is to distribute the Android APK.

1.  The **"Download Beta"** button in `index.html` is linked directly to our **GitHub Releases**.
2.  This allows for "Guerrilla Distribution" without needing the Google Play Store immediately.
3.  The site includes instructions for users to bypass Google Play Protect ("Install Anyway") during the beta phase.

  * **Background:** Charcoal (`#121212`)
